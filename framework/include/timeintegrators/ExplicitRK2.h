/**
 * Base class for three different explicit second-order Runge-Kutta
 * time integration methods:
 * - Explicit midpoint method (ExplicitMidpoint.C)
 * - Heun's method (Heun.C)
 * - Ralston's method (Ralston.C)
 *
 * Each of these methods is characterized by the following generic
 * Butcher tableau:
 * 0   | 0
 * a   | a   0
 * ---------------------
 *     | b1  b2
 *
 * where a, b1, and b2 are constants that define the different
 * methods.
 *
 * The stability function for each of these methods is:
 * R(z) = z*(z + 2)/2 + 1
 *
 * The methods are all explicit, so they are neither A-stable nor L-stable,
 * lim R(z), z->oo = oo
 *
 * See also:
 *   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods
 *   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Midpoint_method
 *   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heun%27s_method
 *
 * All three methods require two mass matrix (linear) system solves
 * per timestep. Although strictly speaking these are "two stage"
 * methods, we treat the "update" step as a third stage, since in
 * finite element analysis the update step requires a mass matrix
 * solve.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: To use the explicit TimeIntegrators derived from this
 * method, you must generally add "implicit=false" to the Kernels,
 * Materials, etc. used in your simulation, so that MOOSE evaluates
 * them correctly!  An important exception are TimeDerivative kernels,
 * which should never be marked "implicit=false".
