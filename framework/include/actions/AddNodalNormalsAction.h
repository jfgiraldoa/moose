/**
 * Action to setup computation of nodal normals.
 *
 * The machinery behind the normal computation is the following:
 * - NodalNormalsPreprocessor is ran over the elements and gather the \f$ \int \d grad_phi \over \d
 * {x|y|z} \d Omega \f$ into three separate vectors
 *   (that live on AuxiliarySystem) - each for one component of the normal.
 * - NodalNormalsEvaluator is than ran over the boundary nodes and takes the above computed
 * integrals and normalizes it.
 *
 * NOTE: the auxiliary system has to have at least one variable on it, so that the vectors for nx,
 * ny and nz have non-zero length.
