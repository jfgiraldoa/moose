/**
 * This is the base class for Samplers.
 *
 * A sampler is responsible for sampling distributions and providing an interface for providing
 * the samples to objects. The sampler is designed to handle any number of random number generators.
 *
 * The main method in this object is the getSamples method which returns the distribution samples.
 * This method will return the same results for each call when the "_generator" from this class
 * is used by child classes.
 *
 * Samplers support the use of "execute_on", which when called results in new set of random numbers,
 * thus after execute() runs the getSamples() method will now produces a new set of random numbers
 * from calls prior to the execute() call.
