# Mesh System

## Overview

In general, MOOSE is not designed for generating finite element meshes. Generally,
[CUBIT](https://cubit.sandia.gov/) from [Sandia National Laboratories](http://www.sandia.gov/) is
recommended for creating meshes, especially complex geometries, for use in MOOSE. CUBIT can be
licensed from CSimSoft for a fee depending that varies based on the type of organization and work
being performed. Other mesh generators can work as long as they output a file format that is
supported by the [FileMesh](/FileMesh.md) object.

## Example Syntax and Mesh Objects

Mesh settings are applied with the `[Mesh]` of the input files, for example the basic input file
syntax for reading a file from a mesh is shown below. For additional information on the other types
of Mesh objects refer to the individual object pages listed below.

!listing test/tests/auxkernels/solution_aux/build.i block=Mesh

!syntax list /Mesh objects=True actions=False subsystems=False

!syntax list /Mesh objects=False actions=False subsystems=True

!syntax list /Mesh objects=False actions=True subsystems=False

## Outputing The Mesh

Since MOOSE contains a lot of ability to read/generate/modify meshes - it's often useful to be able to run all of
the Mesh related portions of the input file and then output the mesh.  This mesh can then be viewed (such as
with Peacock) or used in other MOOSE input files for further combination/modification.

This can be achieved by using the commandline option `--mesh-only`.  By default `--mesh-only` will write a
mesh file with `_in.e` (the opposite of the `_out.e` that is appended from the output system)
appended to the input file name.  You can also optionally provide a mesh filename to
writeout using `--mesh-only output_file.e`.

Here are a couple of examples showing the usage of `--mesh-only`:

```
# Will run all mesh related sections in input_file.i and write out input_file_in.e
./myapp-opt -i input_file.i --mesh-only

# Will do the same but write out mesh_file.e
./myapp-opt -i input_file.i --mesh-only mesh_file.e
```

## Named Entity Support

Human-readable names can be assigned to blocks, sidesets, and nodesets. These names will be
automatically read in and can be used throughout the input file. Mesh generators such as CUBIT will
generally provide the capability internally.  Any parameter that takes entity IDs in the input file
will accept either numbers or "names". Names can also be assigned to IDs on-the-fly in existing
meshes to ease input file maintenance (see example). On-the-fly names will also be written to
Exodus/XDA/XDR files. An illustration for mesh in exodus file format.

## Replicated and Distributed Mesh id=replicated-and-distributed-mesh

The core of the mesh capabilities are derived from [libMesh], which has two underlying
parallel mesh formats: "replicated" and "distributed".

The replicated mesh format is the default format for MOOSE and is the most appropriate format to
utilize for nearly all simulations. In parallel, the replicated format copies the complete mesh to
all processors allowing for efficient access to the geometry elements.

The distributed mesh format is useful when the mesh data structure dominates memory usage. Only the
pieces of the mesh "owned" by a processor are actually stored on the processor. If the mesh is too
large to read in on a single processor, it can be split prior to the simulation.

!alert note
Both the "replicated" and "distributed" mesh formats are parallel with respect to the execution of
the finite element assembly and solve. In both types the solution data is distributed, which is
the portion of the simulation that usually dominates memory demands.

### Distributed Mesh Output Format (Nemesis)

When running a simulation with `DistributedMesh` it is generally desirable to avoid serializing
the mesh to the first rank for output. In the largest case this may cause your simulation to run
out of memory, in smaller cases, it may just cause unecessary communication to serialize your
parallel datastructure. The solution is to use "nemesis" output.

Nemesis creates separate Exodus files that are automatically read by paraview and displayed as
if a normal Exodus mesh had been output. The output files have the following naming convention:

```
<filename>.e.<num_processors>.<rank>

# For example, on a 4 processor run, you can expect filenames like this:
out.e.4.0
out.e.4.1
out.e.4.2
out.e.4.3
```

## Mesh splitting

For large meshes, MOOSE provides the ability to pre-split a mesh for use in the the "distributed"
format/mode.  To split and use a mesh for distributed runs:

```
// For input files with a file-based mesh:
$ moose-app-opt -i your_input-file.i --split-mesh 500,1000,2000 // comma-separated list of split configurations
Splitting 500 ways...
    - writing 500 files per process...
Splitting 1000 ways...
    - writing 1000 files per process...
...

// MOOSE automatically selects the pre-split mesh configuration based on MPI procs
$ mpiexec -n 1000 moose-app-opt -i your_input-file.i --use-split
```

For more details see "[Mesh Splitting](/Mesh/splitting.md)".

## Displaced Mesh

Calculations can take place in either the initial mesh configuration or, when requested, the
"displaced" configuration. To enable displacements, provide a vector of displacement variable names
for each spatial dimension in the 'displacements' parameters within the Mesh block.

!listing modules/tensor_mechanics/test/tests/truss/truss_2d.i block=Mesh

Once enabled, the any object that should operate on the displaced configuration should set the
"use_displaced_mesh" to true. For example, the following snippet enables the computation of a
[Postprocessor](/Postprocessors/index.md) with and without the displaced configuration.

!listing test/tests/postprocessors/displaced_mesh/elemental.i block=Postprocessors

## Mixed Dimension Meshes

MOOSE will function properly when running simulations on meshes containing mixed dimension elements
(e.g. 1D and 2D, 1D and 3D, etc.). Residual calculation, material evaluation, etc should all work properly.

!listing test/tests/mesh/mixed_dim/1d_3d.i block=Mesh

## Unique IDs

There are two "first-class" id types for each mesh entity (elements or nodes): "id and unique_id". Both the id
and unique_id field are unique numbers for the current active set of mesh entities. Active entities are those
that are currently representing the domain but doesn't include "coarse parents" of some elements that may become
active during a coarsening step. The difference however is that unique_ids are never reused, but ids +might+ be.
Generally the id is "good-enough" for almost all use, but if you need guarentees that an element id is never
recycled (because it might be a key to an important map), you should use unique_id.
