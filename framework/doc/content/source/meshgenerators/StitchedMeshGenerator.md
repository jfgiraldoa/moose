# StitchedMeshGenerator

## Overview

The `StitchedMeshGenerator` object allows for multiple mesh files to be
"stitched" together to form a single mesh for use in a simulation. This
generator will combine overlapping nodes and turn overlapping external sides
into internal sides to form a connected mesh.
