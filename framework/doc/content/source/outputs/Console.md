# Console
The Console object in MOOSE is a buffered ostringstream object that should be used to for
all screen based output. Each MooseObject derived class has access to the _console
member for screen writing. Output to this object can be controlled in various ways from
the `[Outputs]` block. Information can be disabled, output at a lower frequency, colored,
or color removed.

## Multiapp Output
When using the MOOSE Multiapp system, Output to the _console object will be automatically
indented and labeled according to the multiapp level. This can make it easier to identify
where output is coming from in a more complex simulation.
