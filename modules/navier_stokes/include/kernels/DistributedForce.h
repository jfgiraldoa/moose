/**
 * The DistributedForce kernel computes the body force due to the acceleration of mass in
 * an element. Following F=ma, the density must be integrated over the volume to yield the mass
 * of the volume. In this kernel, the acceleration is assumed to be a constant defined by up to
 * three dimensional components as input. The density must be obtained from the conservation of
 * mass equation as a coupled variable. Typical use of this kernel is the gravitational force
 * acting upon the fluid.
