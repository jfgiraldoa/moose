/**
 * This class implements a custom line search for use with
 * mechanical contact. The line search is not fancy. It takes two parameters, set in the MOOSE
 * Executioner block: `contact_line_search_ltol` and `contact_line_search_allowed_lambda_cuts`. The
 * allowed_lambda_cuts parameter specifies the number of times the line search is allowed to cut
 * lambda. If allowed to be cut, lambda will be reduced by half, and a new residual will be
 * evaluated. If the residual is smaller with a smaller lambda, then cuts will continue until
 * reaching allowed_lambda_cuts. If the residual is larger with a smaller lambda, then the line
 * search is curtailed and the smaller residual is used. It's recommended that allowed_lambda_cuts
 * be <= 3, with smaller values being used for smaller contact problems. This is to allow necessary
 * residual increases when the transient problem requires significant changes in the contact state.
 *
 * When the contact set is changing, the user may optionally use a looser linear tolerance set by
 * the `contact_line_search_ltol` parameter. Then when the contact set is changing during the
 * beginning of the Newton solve, unnecessary computational expense is avoided. Then when the
 * contact set is resolved late in the Newton solve, the linear tolerance will return to the finer
 * tolerance set through the traditional `l_tol` parameter.
