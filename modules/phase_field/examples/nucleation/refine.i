#
# Example derived from cahn_hilliard.i demonstrating the use of Adaptivity
# with the DiscreteNucleation system. The DiscreteNucleationMarker triggers
# mesh refinement for the nucleus geometry. It is up to the user to specify
# refinement for the physics. In this example this is done using a GradientJumpIndicator
# with a ValueThresholdMarker. The nucleation system marker and the physics marker
# must be combined using a ComboMarker to combine their effect.
