/**
 * A base class of user object for calculating
 * the variable values in ghost element
 * according to specific boundary conditions
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *   1. In CFD, a ghost element means a virtual element that is
 *      outside a mesh and shares a common boundary face
 *      with an element in the mesh.
 *
 *   2. This user object is used in two places.
 *
 *      First, it is used in a slope reconstruction user object,
 *      in which a slope reconstruction scheme in an element
 *      adjacent to a boundary face requires adequate boundary conditions
 *      to ensure globally second-order accurate in space.
 *
 *      Second, it is used in a boundary flux user object,
 *      where boundary conditions are required to properly calculate
 *      the flux vector and Jacobian matrix across the boundary face.
 *
 *   3. Derived classes have to override `getGhostCellValue`.
