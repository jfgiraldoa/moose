/**
 * A boundary condition object for the advection equation
 * using a cell-centered finite volume method
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *   1. This BC kernel itself does not do any complex calculation.
 *      It gets the flux vector and Jacobian matrix
 *      from the boundary flux user object being called.
 *
 *   2. If a system of governing equations is being solved,
 *      the flux vector and Jacobian matrix
 *      are calculated only once for the first equation
 *      and cached for use for the rest of the equations in the system.
 *
 *   3. On the "left" state of the boundary face, the variable value
 *      is interpolated from the reconstructed linear polynomial in the host element,
 *      which is provided from the corresponding material kernel.
 *
 *   4. On the "right" state of the boundary face, the variable value
 *      should be obtained from the bc user object being called.
