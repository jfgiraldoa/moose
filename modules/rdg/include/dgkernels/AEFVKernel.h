/**
 * A dgkernel for the advection equation
 * using a cell-centered finite volume method
 *
 * Notes:
 *
 *   1. This dgkernel itself does not do any complex calculation.
 *      It gets the internal side flux vector and Jacobian matrix
 *      from the internal side flux user object being called.
 *
 *   2. In general, a approximate Riemann solver should be used
 *      in the internal flux user object for calculating the flux
 *
 *   3. If a system of governing equations is being solved,
 *      the flux vector and Jacobian matrix
 *      are calculated only once for the first equation
 *      and cached for use for the rest of the equations in the system.
 *
 *   4. On the "left" and "right" states of the internal side, the variable values
 *      are interpolated from the reconstructed linear polynomials
 *      in the "left" and "right "element, respectively,
 *      which are provided from the corresponding material kernel.
