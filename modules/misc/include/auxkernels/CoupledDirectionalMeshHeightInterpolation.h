/**
 * Couples to some other value and modulates it by the mesh height in a direction.
 *
 * What this means is that a constant field will become a linear field that is zero
 * at the end of the domain that is most negative in the given direction and is that
 * given constant value at the extremum of the mesh in the given direction.
 *
 * This can be useful for specifying linear mesh "stretches".  If you are wanting to stretch
 * a mesh by "5"... put 5 into the field that this couples to and this AuxKernel can create
 * a linear "displacement" field that will give that stretch.
