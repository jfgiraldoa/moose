# This test is to ensure that the smeared cracking model correctly handles finite
# rotation of cracked elements.

# This consists of a single element that is first  subjected to tensile loading
# in the y-direction via a prescribed displacement. This loading is sufficiently
# high to crack the material in that direction, but not completely unload. The
# prescribed displacement is then reversed so that the element is returned to its
# original configuration.

# In the next phase of the analysis, this element is then rotated 90 degrees by
# prescribing the displacement of the bottom of the element. The prescribed
# displacement BC used to crack the element in the first phase is deactivated.

# Once the element is fully rotated, a new BC is activated on what was originally
# the top surface (but is now the surface on the right hand side) to pull in
# the x-direction.

# If everything is working correctly, the model should re-load on the original
# crack (which should be rotated along with the elemnent) up to the peak stress
# in the first phase of the analysis, and then continue the unloading process
# as the crack strains continue to increase. Throughout this analysis, there should
# only be a single crack, as manifested in the crack_flags variables.
