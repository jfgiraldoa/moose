/**
 * ComputeMultipleInelasticStress computes the stress, the consistent tangent
 * operator (or an approximation to it), and a decomposition of the strain
 * into elastic and inelastic parts.  By default finite strains are assumed.
 *
 * Cosserat couple-stress, and the cosserat version of the consistent
 * tangent operator are also computed, but only using Cosserat elasticity.
 *
 * The elastic strain is calculated by subtracting the computed inelastic strain
 * increment tensor from the mechanical strain tensor.  Mechanical strain is
 * considered as the sum of the elastic and inelastic (plastic, creep, ect) strains.
 *
 * This material is used to call the recompute iterative materials of a number
 * of specified inelastic models that inherit from StressUpdateBase.  It iterates
 * over the specified inelastic models until the change in stress is within
 * a user-specified tolerance, in order to produce the stress, the consistent
 * tangent operator and the elastic and inelastic strains for the time increment.
