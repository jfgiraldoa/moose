/**
 * This class represents an assembly of springs and dashpots following
 * a generalized Maxwell model (an arbitrary number of Maxwell
 * units assembled in parallel with a single spring).
 *
 * This class does not attribute the mechanical properties to each spring
 * and dashpot. It must be inherited to do so (see GeneralizedMaxwellModel
 * for an example).
 *
 * This class derives from LinearViscoelasticityBase, and thus contains both
 * the apparent mechanical properties of the material, and the internal variables
 * associated to each of the dashpots in the model. It provides the methods
 * required to perform the time stepping scheme associated with viscoelastic models.
 *
 * See LinearViscoelasticityBase for more information
