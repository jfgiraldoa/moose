/**
 * MultiParameterPlasticityStressUpdate performs the return-map
 * algorithm and associated stress updates for plastic
 * models where the yield function and flow directions
 * depend on multiple parameters (called "stress_params" in the
 * documentation and sp in the code) that
 * are themselves functions of stress.
 *
 * Let the stress_params be S = {S[0], S[1], ... S[N-1]}
 * and define _num_sp = N.
 *
 * For instance, CappedDruckerPrager plasticity has _num_sp = 2
 * and defines
 * S[0] = p = stress.trace()
 * S[1] = q = sqrt(stress.secondInvariant())
 *
 * The point of the stress_params is to reduce the number of
 * degrees of freedom involved in the return-map algorithm
 * (for computational efficiency as all the intensive computation
 * occurs in "stress_param space") and to allow users to
 * write their yield functions, etc, in forms that are
 * clear to them to avoid errors.
 *
 * Derived classes can describe plasticity via multiple yield
 * functions.  The number of yield function is _num_yf.
 * The yield function(s) and flow potential(s)
 * must be functions of the stress_params.
 *
 * Derived classes can use any number of internal parameters.
 * The number of internal parameters is _num_intnl.  The
 * derived classes must define the evolution of these internal
 * parameters, which are typically functions of certain
 * "distances" in the return-mapping procedure.
 *
 * For instance, CappedDruckerPrager plasticity has three
 * yield functions (a smoothed DruckerPrager cone, a tensile failure
 * envelope, and a compressive failure envelope) and two
 * internal parameters (plastic shear strain and plastic tensile strain).
 * The strength parameters (cohesion, friction angle,
 * dilation angle, tensile strength, compressive strength)
 * are functions of these internal parameters.
 *
 * A novel smoothing procedure is used to smooth the derived class's
 * yield functions into a single, smooth yield function.  The
 * smoothing is also performed for the flow potential.  All
 * return-mapping, etc, processes are performed on this single
 * yield function and flow potential.
 *
 * The return-map algorithm implements the updateState method of
 * StressUpdateBase.  In particular, the following system of
 * equations is solved:
 * 0 = _rhs[0] = S[0] - S[0]^trial + ga * E[0, j] * dg/dS[j]
 * 0 = _rhs[1] = S[1] - S[1]^trial + ga * E[1, j] * dg/dS[j]
 * ...
 * 0 = _rhs[N-1] = S[N-1] - S[N-1]^trial + ga * E[N-1, j] * dg/dS[j]
 * 0 = _rhs[N] = f(S, intnl)
 * (here there is an implied sum over j)
 * for the _num_sp stress_params S, and the single scalar ga
 * (actually I solve for gaE = ga * _En, where _En is a normalising
 * factor so that gaE is of similar magnitude to the S variables).
 * In general E[a, b] = dS[a]/dstress(i, j) E(i, j, k, l) dS[b]/dstress(k, l),
 * and in the code below it is assumed that the E[a, b] are independent
 * of the stress_params, but adding a dependence would only require
 * some Jacobian terms to be modified.
 * There are N+1 rhs equations to solve.  Here f is
 * the smoothed yield function, so the last equation is the admissibility
 * condition (the returned stress lies on the yield surface) and g
 * is the flow potential so the other conditions implement the normality
 * condition.  It is up to the derived classes to defined E[i, j]
 * so that the rhs really represents the normality condition.
 *
 * For instance, CappedDruckerPrager has (with Eijkl being the elasticity
 * tensor):
 * E[0, 0] = _Epp = Eijkl.sum3x3()
 * E[0, 1] = 0
 * E[1, 0] = 0
 * E[1, 1] = Eijkl(0, 1, 0, 1)
