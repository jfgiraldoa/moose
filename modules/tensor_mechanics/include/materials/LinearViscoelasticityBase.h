/**
 * This class is a base class for materials consisting of an assembly of linear springs and
 * dashpots. It represents the arrangement of the system (typically, in parallel or in series),
 * the mechanical  * properties of each individual spring and dashpot in the model, and the
 * internal strains associated with each dashpot.
 *
 * To use a linear viscoelastic model, the user must provide a LinearViscoelasticityManager, that
 * will initialize and update the internal time-stepping scheme at the beginning and the end of
 * each time step.
 *
 * To compute the stress associated with a linear viscoelastic model, the user must either use a
 * ComputeLinearViscoelasticStress material (for total small strain formulations), or a
 * ComputeMultipleInelasticStress material associated with a LinearViscoelasticStressUpdate material
 * if there are multiple sources of inelastic strains (this requires to use incremental strains).
 *
 * The rate-dependent problem is solved using an internal 1-step finite difference scheme.
 * The scheme itself depends only on the arrangement of the system, and not the individual
 * properties. The scheme acts upon a series of internal strain variables, stored in the
 * _viscous_strains material properties. At the start of each time step, the apparent
 * elastic properties of the assembly and the apparent creep strain are calculated. The
 * rate-dependent problem becomes then equivalent to a purely elastic system. At the end of the
 * time step, the internal strain variables are updated according to the current
 * values of the stress and the strain.
 *
 * The real system refers to
 *     stress = elasticity_tensor : (mechanical_strain - creep_strain)
 *
 * The internal time-stepping scheme uses the following conversion:
 *     stress = apparent_elasticity_tensor : (mechanical_strain - apparent_creep_strain)
 *
 * The creep strain is generally driven only by the mechanical stress, but it can be driven by an
 * eigenstrain in addition to the stress. This means that the creep strain is calculated as if the
 * eigenstrain were to contribute to the global mechanical stress of the system.
 *
 * The determination of the apparent properties, as well as the update of the internal strain
 * variables depend only on the arrangement of the system (in parralel or series), and not their
 * actual properties. These calculations are generally only performed at the beginning of the time
 * step, but the user (or derived classes) can enforce these to be performed at each step of the
 * nonlinear solver if necessary.
 *
 * The time-integration uses a 1-step Newmark finite difference scheme. This scheme is controlled
 * by a parameter theta (between 0 and 1, default-value 1). Theta can be automatically calibrated
 * depending on the value of the dashpot viscosities in order to reproduce the exact integral
 * of exponential series (integration_rule = "zienkiewicz"). Theta cannot be set to 0 (purely
 * explicit system), and setting theta < 0.5 may cause the scheme to diverge (the "backward_euler"
 * "mid_point" and "zienkiewicz" schemes are unconditionally stable).
 *
 * This class is virtual. Deriving this class must be done in two steps.
 * 1. Classes inheriting directly from LinearViscoelasticityBase must represent a distinct
 * spring-dashpot architecture (examples in GeneralizedKelvinVoigtBase and GeneralizedMaxwellBase),
 * and must inherit only methods related to the time-stepping scheme itself.
 * 2. Classes inheriting inderectly from LinearViscoelasticityBase must provide the actual
 * properties of each spring and dashpot in the assembly (examples in GeneralizedKelvinVoigtModel
 * and GeneralizedMaxwellModel). These classes must not override methods related to the
 * time-stepping scheme.
 *
 * This class does not store the true creep strain of the material, but an equivalent creep strain
 * adapted for numerical efficiency. The true creep strain itself is declared by
 * ComputeLinearViscoelasticStress or LinearViscoelasticStressUpdate.
