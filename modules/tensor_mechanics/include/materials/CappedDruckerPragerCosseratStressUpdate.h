/**
 * CappedDruckerPragerCosseratStressUpdate performs the return-map
 * algorithm and associated stress updates for plastic
 * models that describe capped Drucker-Prager plasticity in the
 * layered Cosserat setting
 *
 * This plastic model is ideally suited to a material (eg rock)
 * that has different compressive, tensile and shear
 * strengths.  Any of these strengths may be set large to
 * accommodate special situations.  For instance, setting
 * the compressive strength large is appropriate if there
 * is no chance of compressive failure in a model.
 *
 * This plastic model has two internal parameters:
 *  - a "shear" internal parameter which parameterises the
 *    amount of shear plastic strain.  The cohesion, friction
 *    angle, and dilation angle are assumed to be functions
 *    of this internal parameter.
 *  - a "tensile" internal parameter which parameterises the
 *    amount of tensile plastic strain.  The tensile strength
 *    and compressive strength are assumed to be functions of
 *    this internal parameter.  This means, for instance, that
 *    failure in tension can cause the compressive strenght
 *    to soften, as would be expected in rock-mechanics
 *    scenarios.
 *
 * This plasticity model assumes that the flow rule involves an
 * isotropic built from the user-supplied Young and Poisson.
 * That is, the return-map process does NOT flow using the
 * elasticity tensor in the stress-strain law, which is unsymmetric
 * in general (in the Cosserat setting).  Physically this corresponds
 * to the notion that the "host" medium for the Cosserat grains/layers
 * is failing via Drucker-Prager, and not the Cosserat grains/layers
 * themselves.
