/*
 * TorqueReaction calculates the torque in 2D and 3D about a user-specified
 * axis of rotation centered at a user-specied origin. The default origin is the
 * global coordinate system origin: (0.0,0.0,0.0).
 *
 * TorqueReaction takes a scalar approach to calculating the sum of the
 * acting torques by projecting both the reaction force and the position vector
 * (the coordinates of the node upon which the force is applied) onto the axis of
 * rotation and applying the Pythagorean theorem, as in a statics course.  This
 * scalar approach allows the postprocessor to accept any axis of rotation direction.
 *
 * TorqueReaction is similar to TorqueReaction in SolidMechanics but does
 * not replace the TorqueReaction postprocessor; different assumptions were used
 * to derive the SolidMechanics TorqueReaction postprocessor.
