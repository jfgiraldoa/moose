/**
 * VolumeWeightedWeibull generates a spatially randomized field that follows
 * a Weibull distribution weighted by the factor (V_ref/V_el)^1/m, where
 * V_ref is a reference volume from which the experimental data is obtained,
 * V_el is the finite element volume, and m is the Weibull modulus, to account
 * for the fact that larger material samples are more likely to contain defects.
 * This follows the approach of Strack, Leavy, and Brannon, IJNME (2015)
