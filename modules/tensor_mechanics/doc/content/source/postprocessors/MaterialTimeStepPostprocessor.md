# Material Time Step Postprocessor

!syntax description /Postprocessors/MaterialTimeStepPostprocessor

## Description

The `MaterialTimeStepPostprocessor` works in conjunction with material models to
compute the appropriate maximum time step allowed by individual material models.
For creep or plasticity models, this maximum time step size is governed by an
allowable inelastic strain increment, but a variety of methods could be used by
individual material models to compute their acceptable time step. For continuum
damage models, the maximum time step size is governed by the allowable increment
of damage over a single time step.

### Creep Strain Example

The maximum time step size is a numerical tool used to ensure the calculation of
physically reasonable inelastic strains and to improve convergence of the inelastic
material model. As an example, the maximum allowable time step computation for
a creep model has the form
\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:limiting_ts}
  \Delta t |_{limit} = \Delta t \cdot \frac{\Delta \epsilon^{inel}_{max}}{\Delta \epsilon^{inel}}
\end{equation}
where $\Delta \epsilon^{inel}_{max}$ is the maximum effective inelastic strain
increment (a default value of 1e-4), set by the user, and $\Delta \epsilon^{inel}$
is the current scalar effective inelastic strain increment.

### Mesh-Wide Evaluation

The `MaterialTimeStepPostprocessor` collects the time step limitations from all
of the quadrature points in the simulation mesh and stores the minimum value.
This minimum allowable time step size value is then used by the
[IterationAdaptiveDT](/IterationAdaptiveDT.md)
to restrict the time step size based on the limit calculated in the previous
time step.

Note that the [IterationAdaptiveDT](/IterationAdaptiveDT.md)
will apply the limiting time step size value from the `MaterialTimeStepPostprocessor`
only if that value is less than maximum time step size value calculated by the
internal [IterationAdaptiveDT](/IterationAdaptiveDT.md)
adaptive time step size algorithm.

is enforced in the next simulation time step.

### Minimum Time Step Calculated in Material Models

The calculation of the maximum allowable timestep is dependent on each individual
material: both the maximum allowable inelastic strain increment and the method of
calculating the current inelastic strain, [eqn:limiting_ts], are defined separately
for each material.
Given this material dependent nature, the maximum time step value is calculated
separately by the [RadialReturnStressUpdate](/RadialReturnStressUpdate.md)
materials at each quadrature point.
The `MaterialTimeStepPostprocessor` then determines the minimum time step size
value from all of the quadrature points in the simulation.

Initially the value of the maximum time step size is set to `std::numeric_limits<Real>::max()`.
Once the inelastic material model begins to calculate inelastic strain, the value
of the allowable time step size varies with the inelastic strain computation.

The limiting time step size is stored within a material property called `matl_timestep_limit`.
This material property can be set up either by the
[ComputeMultipleInelasticStress](/ComputeMultipleInelasticStress.md) model (for creep
or plastic strains) or the [ComputeDamageStress](/ComputeDamageStress.md) for
continuum damage models.

### Minimum Time Step Size Based on Number of Elements in which a Property Changes

The allowable time step size can also be controlled by the total number of elements in which a
material property changes over the course of the time step. This can be used in the context
of continuum damage to limit the number of elements damaged at a single time step. To do so,
the user needs to define a scalar material property with the input parameter
`elements_changed_property` as well as the maximum acceptable number of elements changed
using the `elements_changed` input parameter. When these are defined, the
`MaterialTimeStepPostprocessor` will sweep over the entire mesh and count the number of
elements in which the selected property has changed at at least one quadrature point.
The limiting time step is then calculated using the ratio between the current number of
elements changed $N_{changed}$ and the maximum value $N_{max}$.

\begin{equation}
  \label{eqn:limiting_ts_count}
  \Delta t |_{limit} = \Delta t \cdot \frac{N_{changed}}{N_{max}}
\end{equation}

The user can define a `elements_changed_threshold` to detect a change in property.
This can be for example used to count the number of elements in which the damage increases
by at least a specific amount.

This method is optional and is only active if both `elements_changed_property`
and `elements_changed` are defined. The `MaterialTimeStepPostprocessor` then uses the
minimum between the value provided by the material model (see above) or by the number of elements
changed. If the input parameter `use_material_timestep_limit` is set to `false`, only the number
of elements changed is used.
