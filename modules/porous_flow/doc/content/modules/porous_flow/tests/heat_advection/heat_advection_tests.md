# Heat advection in a 1D bar

Consider the case of a single-phase fluid in 1 dimension, $0\leq x
\leq 1$, with the porepressure fixed at the boundaries:
\begin{equation}
P(x=0, t) = 1 \ \ \ \mathrm{and}\ \ \ P(x=1, t) = 0 \ .
\end{equation}
With zero gravity, and high fluid bulk modulus, the Darcy equation
implies that the solution is $P(x, t) = 1 - x$, with
\begin{equation}
v = k/\mu
\end{equation}
being the constant "Darcy
velocity" from $x=0$ to $x=1$.  (The velocity of the individual
  fluid particles, this is divided by the porosity.).  Here $k$ is the porous medium's
permeability, and $\mu$ is the fluid dynamic viscosity.

Suppose that the fluid internal energy is given by $CT$, where $C$ is
the specific heat capacity and $T$ is its temperature.  Assuming that
$P/\rho \ll CT$, then the fluid's enthalpy is also $CT$.  In this
case, the energy equation reads
\begin{equation}
\left((1 - \phi)\rho_{R}C_{R} + \phi\rho C \right) \frac{\partial
  T}{\partial t} + C \rho v \frac{\partial T}{\partial x} = 0 \ .
\end{equation}
This is the wave equation with velocity
\begin{equation}
v_{T} = \frac{C\rho v}{(1 - \phi)\rho_{R}C_{R} + \phi\rho C} \ .
\end{equation}
Recall that the "Darcy velocity" is $v=k/\mu$.

Let the initial condition for $T$ be $T(x, t=0) = 200$.  Apply the
boundary conditions
\begin{equation}
T(x=0, t) = 300 \ \ \ \mathrm{and} \ \ \ T(x=1, t) = 200 \ .
\end{equation}
At $t=0$ this creates a front at $x=0$.  Choose the parameters $C=2$,
$C_{R}=1$, $\rho=1000$, $\rho_{R}=125$, $\phi=0.2$, $k=1.1$, $\mu=4.4$
(all in consistent units), so that $v_{T}=1$ is the front's velocity.

The input file:

The sharp front is *not* maintained by
MOOSE.  This is due to numerical diffusion, which is particularly strong when full upwinding is used.  This is explained in great detail in the pages on [numerical stabilization](stabilization.md).  Nevertheless, MOOSE advects the smooth front with the correct
velocity, as shown in [heat_advection_1d.fig].

The sharp front is not maintained by MOOSE even when no
upwinding is used.  In the case at hand, which uses a fully-saturated
single-phase fluid, the [FullySaturatedHeatAdvection](PorousFlowFullySaturatedHeatAdvection.md) Kernel
may be used in order to compare with the standard fully-upwinded
Kernels.  The input file using the fully-saturated approach:

!listing modules/porous_flow/test/tests/heat_advection/heat_advection_1d_fully_saturated.i

The FullySaturated Kernels do not employ any upwinding
whatsoever, so less numerical diffusion is expected.  This is demonstrated in
[heat_advection_1d.fig].  Two additional points may also be
nocied: (1) the lack of upwinding has produced a "bump" in the
temperature profile near the hotter side; (2) the lack of upwinding
means the temperature profile moves slightly slower than it should.
These two affects reduce as the mesh density is increased, however.

Finally, the same simulation may be run using [Kuzmin-Turek](kt.md) stabilization, with input file (that employs the [PorousFlowFullySaturated](PorousFlowFullySaturated.md) Action):

The fluid flows with constant Darcy velocity of 0.25m/s to the right, and this advects a temperature front at velocity 1m/s to the right.  The pictures above that the numerical implementation of PorousFlow (including upwinding) diffuses sharp fronts, but advects them at the correct velocity (notice the centre of the upwinded front is at the correct position in each picture).  Less diffusion is experienced without upwinding or with KT stabilization.  Left: temperature 0.1s.  Right: temperature at 0.6s. id=heat_advection_1d.fig
