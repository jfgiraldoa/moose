# Injection ala Buckley and Leverett

PorousFlow is compared with a simple single-phase one-dimensional
Buckley-Leverett problem [citep!buckley_leverett].  The single-phase fluid moves in a region
$0\leq x\leq 15\,$m.  A fully-saturated front initially sits at
position $x=5$, while the region $x>5$ is initially unsaturated.  With
zero suction function $P_{c} = 0$, there is no diffusion of the sharp
front, and it progresses towards the right (increasing $x$).

This is a difficult problem to simulate numerically as maintaining the sharp
front is hard.  The front's speed is independent of the relative
permeability, since the fluid is flowing from a fully-saturated region
(where $\kappa_{\mathrm{rel}}=1$).  This problem is therefore a good
test of the [full upwinding](upwinding.md).

In the simulation listed above, the pressure at the left boundary is kept
fixed at $P_{0}=0.98\,$MPa, while the right boundary is kept fixed at
$P_{15}=-20000\,$Pa, so the difference is $1\,$MPa.  The medium's
permeability is set to $\kappa = 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{m}^{2}$ and its
porosity is $\phi = 0.15$.  It is not possible to use a zero suction
function in the MOOSE implementation, but using the van Genuchten
parameters $\alpha = 10^{-3}\,$Pa$^{-1}$ and $m=0.8$ approximates it.
The fluid viscosity is $\mu = 10^{-3}\,$Pa.s.

The initial condition is
\begin{equation}
P(t=0) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
P_{0} - (P_{0}-P_{15})x/5 & \ \ \ \mathrm{for }\ \ x<5 \\
P_{15} & \ \ \ \mathrm{for }\ \ x\geq 5
\end{array}
\right. \ ,
\end{equation}
which is shown in
[bl_setup.figa].  With the suction function defined above
this gives
\begin{equation}
S(t=0) = \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
1 & \ \ \ \mathrm{for }\ \ x\leq 4.9 \\
6\times 10^{-6} & \ \ \ \mathrm{for} \ \ x \geq 5
\end{array}
\right.
\end{equation}

The region on the left is fully saturated, while the region on the right has saturation 0.000006.  During simulation the value of porepressure on the left boundary is held fixed.  id=bl_setup.figa

Good approximations for the pressure $P(x,t)$
and the front position $f(t)$ may be determined from
\begin{equation}
\begin{array}{rcl}
\frac{{\mathrm d} f}{{\mathrm d} t} & = & -\frac{\kappa}{\phi\mu}
\left.\frac{\partial  P}{\partial x}\right|_{x = f} \ , \\
P(x,t) & = & \left\{
\begin{array}{ll}
P_{0} - (P_{0}-P_{15})x/f & \ \ \mathrm{ for }\ \ x\leq f  \\
P_{15} &\ \ \mathrm{ for }\ \  x>f
\end{array}
\right. \ ,
\label{eqn.predicted.bl.posn.eqna}
\end{array}
\end{equation}
which has solution
\begin{equation}
f(t) = \sqrt{f(0)^{2} + \frac{2\kappa}{\phi\mu}(P_{0}-P_{15})t} \ .
\end{equation}
For the parameters listed above, the front will be at position
$f=9.6\,$m at $t=50\,$s.  This solution is only valid for zero
capillary suction.  A nonzero suction function will tend to diffuse
the sharp front.

With coarse meshes it is impossible to simulate a sharp front, of
course, since the front is spread over at least one element.

[satfront_figa] shows the results from a MOOSE simulation
with a uniform mesh of size $0.1\,$m.  At $t=50\,$s the front in this
simulation sits at $x=9.6\,$m as desired.  However, the simulation
takes $10\,$seconds to complete due to the very low values of saturation
obtained for van Genuchten $\alpha=10^{-3}\,$Pa$^{-1}$.  Other
simulations give similar results but run much faster.  For instance,
the test suite listed above uses the van-Genuchten parameter
$\alpha=10^{-4}\,$Pa$^{-1}$, but the front diffuses a little into the
unsaturated region (the front sits between $x=9.7\,$m and $x=10.4\,$m
at $t=50\,$s).
