# Apply a piecewise-linear sink flux to the right-hand side and watch fluid flow to it
#
# This test has a single phase with two components.  The test initialises with
# the porous material fully filled with component=1.  The left-hand side is fixed
# at porepressure=1 and mass-fraction of the zeroth component being unity.
# The right-hand side has a very strong piecewise-linear flux that keeps the
# porepressure~0 at that side.  Fluid mass is extracted by this flux in proportion
# to the fluid component mass fraction.
#
# Therefore, the zeroth fluid component will flow from left to right (down the
# pressure gradient).
#
# The important DE is
# porosity * dc/dt = (perm / visc) * grad(P) * grad(c)
# which is true for c = mass-fraction, and very large bulk modulus of the fluid.
# For grad(P) constant in time and space (as in this example) this is just the
# advection equation for c, with velocity = perm / visc / porosity.  The parameters
# are chosen to velocity = 1 m/s.
# In the numerical world, and especially with full upwinding, the advection equation
# suffers from diffusion.  In this example, the diffusion is obvious when plotting
# the mass-fraction along the line, but the average velocity of the front is still
# correct at 1 m/s.
