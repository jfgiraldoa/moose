/**
 * Base class to compute Advective fluxes.  Specifically,
 * computes K_ij, D_ij, L_ij, R+, R-, f^a_ij detailed in
 * D Kuzmin and S Turek "High-resolution FEM-TVD schemes based on a fully multidimensional flux
 * limiter" Journal of Computational Physics 198 (2004) 131-158
 * Then combines the results to produce the residual and Jacobian contributions that
 * may be used by Kernels
 *
 * K_ij is a measure of flux from node i to node j
 * D_ij is a diffusion matrix that stabilizes K_ij (K+D has the LED property)
 * L = K + D
 * R^+_i and R^-_i and f^a_{ij} quantify how much antidiffusion to allow around node i
