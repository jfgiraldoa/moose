/**
 * Base class for capillary pressure for multiphase flow in porous media. To implement
 * an effective saturation formulation, override effectiveSaturation() and derivatives.
 * To implement a capillary pressure curve that will include the logarithmic extension,
 * override capillaryPressureCurve() and derivatives.
 *
 * Note: Capillary pressure is calculated as a function of true saturation, not
 * effective saturation (saturation minus residual). Derivatives are returned wrt
 * true saturation, so no scaling of them is required in objects using these methods.
 *
 * Includes an optional logarithmic extension in the low saturation region where
 * capillary pressure can go to infinity as saturation tends to 0. Calculation of
 * logarithmic extension from Webb, A simple extension of two-phase characteristic
 * curves to include the dry region, Water Resources Research 36, 1425-1430 (2000)
 * The logarithmic extension is only computed for qp=0.  If your overriding class
 * has no qp dependence (capillary pressure is a function only of saturation, for
 * example) then no changes are required.  Otherwise, if you use log_extension,
 * you will have to modify this base class to correctly calculate the log-extension
 * parameters at each quadpoint.
