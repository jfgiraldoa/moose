   * Rachford-Rice equation for vapor fraction. Can be solved analytically for two
   * components in two phases, but must be solved iteratively using a root finding
   * algorithm for more components. This equation has the nice property
   * that it is monotonic in the interval [0,1], so that only a small number of
   * iterations are typically required to find the root.
   *
   * The Rachford-Rice equation can also be used to check whether the phase state
   * is two phase, single phase gas, or single phase liquid.
   * Evaluate f(v), the Rachford-Rice equation evaluated at the vapor mass fraction.
   *
   * If f(0) < 0, then the mixture is below the bubble point, and only a single phase
   * liquid can exist
   *
   * If f(1) > 0, then the mixture is above the dew point, and only a single phase gas exists.
   *
   * If f(0) >= 0 and f(1) <= 0, the mixture is between the bubble and dew points, and both
   * gas and liquid phases exist.
