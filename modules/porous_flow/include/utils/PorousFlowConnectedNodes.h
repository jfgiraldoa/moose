/**
 * Class designed to hold node ID information and information
 * about nodal connectivity.
 * Node ID is either:
 * - global, meaning that it is the number assigned to the node in the mesh
 * - sequential, meaning that it is the number used within this class
 * The sequential numbering runs from zero to number_of_nodes - 1
 *
 * The use case of interest in PorousFlow is where many quantities are
 * recorded at each node in the mesh.  To record this, a std::vector<quantity>
 * may be used.  But if the global node IDs are sparsely distributed between
 * zero and the maximum node number, then basing the std::vector on
 * global ID is inefficient because there are many elements in the
 * std::vector that are unused.  Instead, a std::vector based on
 * the sequential node ID may be used, which is optimally memory efficient.
 * (A std::map<dof_id_type, quantity> may be used, but it is slow.)
 *
 * Nodal connectivity is defined between two global node IDs.  Note
 * that it is uni-directional, meaning that if node 12 is connected to
 * node 321, then node 321 is not necessarily connected to node 12
 * (the user must explicitly add both the 12->321 and 321->12 connections if that is desired).
 *
 * This class is designed to be used as follows:
 * (1) instantiation
 * (2) populate the nodal information using addGlobalNode
 * (3) finalizeAddingGlobalNodes()
 * (4) populate the connectivity using addConnection
 * (5) finalizeAddingConnections()
 * (6) functions like sequentialID and sequentialNeighborsOfGlobalID are now ready for use
