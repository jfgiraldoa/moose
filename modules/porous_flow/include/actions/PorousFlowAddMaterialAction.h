/**
 * Action to automatically ensure that PorousFlowMaterials are correctly evaluated
 * at either the qps, nodes, or both
 *
 * This action works by checking all materials added in the input file. If a material
 * is a valid PorousFlowMaterial, then it does one of the following:
 *   1) If the at_nodes parameter has been set by the user, then it leaves that
 *      material alone (this assumes that the user has correctly added that material).
 *   2) If the at_nodes parameter has not been set by the user, then the action checks to
 *      see if this material is required at the qps, nodes or both, and makes sure that the
 *      correct versions are added.
 *   3) If a PorousFlowJoiner material is included in the input file, it does nothing (as
 *      the PorousFlowAddMaterialJoiner action will check for these and give a message that
 *      these materials are no longer required in the input file)
