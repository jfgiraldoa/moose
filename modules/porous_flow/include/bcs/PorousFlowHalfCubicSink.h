/**
 * Applies a flux sink to a boundary.  The base flux
 * defined by PorousFlowSink is multiplied by a cubic.
 * Denote x = porepressure - center, or in the case of
 * heat fluxes with no fluid, x = temperature - center.  Then
 * Then Flux out = (max/cutoff^3)*(2x + cutoff)(x - cutoff)^2 for cutoff < x < 0.
 * Flux out = max for x >= 0.
 * Flux out = 0 for x <= cutoff.
 * This is typically used for modelling evapotranspiration
 * from the top of a groundwater model
