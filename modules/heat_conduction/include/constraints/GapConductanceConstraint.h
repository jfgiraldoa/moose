/**
 * This Constraint implements thermal contact using a "gap
 * conductance" model in which the flux is represented by an
 * independent "Lagrange multiplier" like variable.  This formulation
 * is not derived from a constrained optimization problem, so it is
 * not a Lagrange multiplier formulation in the classic sense, but it
 * does have the benefit of producing an improved approximation to the
 * flux (better than simply differentiating the finite element
 * solution) and is a systematic approach for accurately computing
 * integrals on mismatched grids. For more information on this
 * formulation, see the following references:

 * The PDF avaialable from http://tinyurl.com/gmmhbe9 explains the
 * formulation in more detail.  In the documentation below, we use the
 * notation from the PDF above, and refer to the "primal" and "LM"
 * equations, where primal refers to the heat transfer equation
 * including the gap heat flux contribution, and "LM" refers to the
 * equation for computing the flux, i.e. the Lagrange multiplier
 * variable. Likewise, the term "primal variable" refers to the
 * temperature variable.
