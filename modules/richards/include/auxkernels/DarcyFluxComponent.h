/**
 * Computes a component of the Darcy flux:
 * -k_ij/mu (nabla_j P - w_j)
 * where k_ij is the permeability tensor,
 * mu is the fluid viscosity,
 * P is the fluid pressure (the variable)
 * and w_j is the fluid weight
 * This is measured in m^3 . s^-1 . m^-2
 *
 * Sometimes the fluid velocity is required,
 * rather than the flux.  In this case
 * velocity_scaling may be used, and the
 * result quoted above is multiplied by
 * (1/velocity_scaling)
