# Framework Development

The articles attached to this page are useful if you intend on contributing to the MOOSE reposistory. Information about the repository
structure, code standards, testing, and software quality are all available here. If you are new to Git, we've created some information
about how to get up and running here as well.

For development of MOOSE-based applications see [Application Development](application_development/index.md).
