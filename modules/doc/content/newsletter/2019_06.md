## PorousFlow: Reduction of Numerical Diffusion

A new type of numerical stabilization has been added to PorousFlow to complement the existing "full upwind" and "no stabilization" choices.  The aim is to reduce numerical diffusion.  The code is based on the theoretical work of Kuzmin and Turek.  Users are strongly encouraged to experiment with this new feature so we can collectively learn the strengths and weaknesses in real simulations.  Only [minor changes to input files](porous_flow/kt.md) are needed to activate the new stabilization.  The numerical stabilization [lead page](porous_flow/stabilization.md) lists pros and cons of various stabilization schemes and provides links to pages that explain and quantify numerical diffusion.
