## GCC

We need a modern C++11 capable compiler. Our minimum requirements are: GCC !!package minimum_gcc!!, Clang !!package minimum_clang!!. This section will focus on building a GCC !!package gcc!! compiler stack.

What version of GCC do we have?

```bash
gcc --version

gcc (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-4)
Copyright (C) 2015 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
```

If your version is less than !!package minimum_gcc!!, you will need to build a newer version. If your version is at or
greater than !!package minimum_gcc!!, you have the option of skipping the GCC section.

!package! code
cd $STACK_SRC
curl -L -O http://mirrors.concertpass.com/gcc/releases/gcc-__GCC__/gcc-__GCC__.tar.gz
tar -xf gcc-__GCC__.tar.gz -C .
!package-end!

Obtain GCC pre-reqs:

!package! code max-height=450
cd $STACK_SRC/gcc-__GCC__
./contrib/download_prerequisites
!package-end!

Configure, build and install GCC:

!package! code
mkdir $STACK_SRC/gcc-build
cd $STACK_SRC/gcc-build

../gcc-__GCC__/configure --prefix=$PACKAGES_DIR/gcc-__GCC__ \
--disable-multilib \
--enable-languages=c,c++,fortran,jit \
--enable-checking=release \
--enable-host-shared \
--with-pic

make -j #   (where # is the number of cores available)

make install
!package-end!

Any errors during configure/make will need to be investigated on your own. Every operating system I
have come across has its own nuances of getting stuff built. Normally any issues are going to be
solved by installing the necessary development libraries using your system package manager (apt-get,
yum, zypper, etc). Hint: I would search the internet for 'how to build GCC !!package gcc!! on (insert the
name/version of your operating system here)'

!alert! note
In order to utilize our newly built GCC !!package gcc!! compiler, we need to set some variables:

!package! code
export PATH=$PACKAGES_DIR/gcc-__GCC__/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PACKAGES_DIR/gcc-__GCC__/lib64:$PACKAGES_DIR/gcc-__GCC__/lib:$PACKAGES_DIR/gcc-__GCC__/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/__GCC__:$PACKAGES_DIR/gcc-__GCC__/libexec/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/__GCC__:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
!package-end!

!alert-end!
