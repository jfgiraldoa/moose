/**
 * Defines an Axisymmetric Isotropic Elasticity Tensor.
 *
 * The input is any two of the following:
 *
 * Youngs Modulus
 * Poissons Ration
 * First and Second Lame Coefficients (lambda and mu)
 * Bulk Modulus
 *
 * Internally this class uses the Lame Coefficients.
 * Everything is is transformed to these coefficients.
 *
 * Note that by default this tensor is _constant_... meaning
 * that it never changes after the first time it is computed.
 *
 * If you want to modify this behavior you can pass in
 * false to the constructor.
