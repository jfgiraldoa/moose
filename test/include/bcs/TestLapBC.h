/**
 * This BC enforces: grad(u) \cdot n = (1/2)*Lap(u) weakly.  This is
 * consistent with the exact solution, for which we know that:
 * grad(u).n = 2 on the right-hand boundary, and Lap(u) = 4
 * everywhere.  This is just an artificial way to introduce the
 * Laplacian into the BC.  There is a minus sign since this term is
 * moved to the LHS of the equation when the residual is formed.
