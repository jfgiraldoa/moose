/**
 * ChannelGradientBC implements a boundary condition like that for heat transfer
 * between a convecting fluid and a solid surface: \f$q = h(T_{\infty} - T_s)\f$
 * where \f$T_{\infty}\f$ is the bulk fluid temperature, \f$T_s\f$ is the temperature
 * of the solid surface, and \f$h\f$ is a heat transfer coefficient usually obtained
 * through a Nusselt-like correlation. The difference in temperature is provided by
 * a ChannelGradientVectorPostprocessor. Note that this boundary condition is only
 * applicable to boundaries with a single varying coordinate (e.g. constant x and y,
 * varying z)
