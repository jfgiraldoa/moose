/**
 * Penalizes the difference between the current flux and desired flux,
 * similarly to penalty Dirichlet BCs. Implements the term:
 *
 * \int (p * (du/dn - dg/dn) * dv/dn) dx
 *
 * where p is the (large) penalty parameter, du/dn is the normal flux,
 * and dg/dn is the normal component of the gradient of the true solution.
 *
 * We allow the user to provide the components of the true flux, and
 * then compute g for them by dotting those components with the
 * outward unit normal. This class is designed to impose a given value
 * of the flux as an essential BC in the biharmonic problem.
